Some stuff to crack wallets 

## Cryptowalletcracker.py 
A simple python crypto wallet cracker that gets an address from a mnemonic passphrase.
It uses blockchain info to get the balance of the address .

## Software 
This Software is being sold by scammers, I looked at the code and didnt find any thing that really searches or verifys the mnemonic passphrase
Normaly you have a installer but i modified it so you need to extract the file
